            </blockquote>
            <p>Well, no, it's not that simple, let me explain</p>
            <p>If you have a weak NVIDIA graphics card just like me, for example MX350, which is for
                notebook laptops,
                you may have noticed immediately that the card is not giving it's full performance compared to windows,
                you may have
                thought, maybe gaming on Linux or Ubuntu is not yet ready for gaming or something like that and that
                people may have
                lied about getting the same performance as windows in games using proton or just lucky, or maybe they
                got an RTX
                card, if not, at least I did ðŸ˜”.</p>
            <p>Until ...</p>
            <p>Until I tried Counter-strike 2, a native Linux game, it should run smoothly no matter what,
                it should
                even run better than windows, there is no proton layer that translates code .</p>
            <p>It was bad, I am talking about having under 60 fps in the game, this is a native game that
                is meant to
                be played om Linux systems, what is wrong with my Ubuntu desktop or NVIDIA card ?</p>
            <p>Turns out, it's NVIDIA, especially that NVIDIA X server settings APP, it's not about not
                having the
                latest driver, it's about the NVIDIA card not utilizing itself to max performance, I noticed that the
                fan speed is
                slow, the laptop didn't heat as much, something is wrong, in windows when I play games, the laptop
                sounds like a jet
                plane, but not on Ubuntu, why ? Hmmmm...</p>
            <p>I tried what I know, I tested and found out that,</p>
            <p>This is misleading :</p>
            <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7lvv3r3f2n7f3rianmvd.png"
                alt="NVIDIA Powermizer preferred mode maximum performance" />
            <p>It's not truly max performance, to explain further, read this hint :</p>
            <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/20ejtehd92ejo96m01m8.png"
                alt="NVIDIA Powermizer preferred mode hint" />
            <p>In short</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Auto = driver picks (it will pick Adaptive most of the time)</li>
                <li>Adaptive = clock speed will change based on card utilization</li>
                <li>Prefer maximum performance = hint to the driver to do it's best</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In games, prefer maximum performance, the fps fluctuates too much, it's annoying and you
                will lose to
                your enemy, I think hinting is not enough, after all, no one knows how the driver works because it a
                proprietary
                driver, that's why, I suggest to put it on auto, let the driver do it's magic and let it decide.</p>
            <p>But that is not enough, even with this noted, it's still not the true power of my card, I
                tried and
                tested and found out that I need to do a <strong>restart</strong> with <strong>performance mode
                    on</strong> in
                Ubuntu <strong>power mode</strong> options each time I want to change an NVIDIA option WHILE the laptop
                is plugged
                to the charger or it will just NOT WORK.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>To summarize : you need to set NVIDIA PowerMizer settings, preferred mode to auto, plus
                    your power
                    mode to performance in Ubuntu then restart while the laptop is plugged to the charger, starting up
                    with
                    performance mode and having the laptop plugged in will get you 98% same performance as windows.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>note: you can set the graphics quality for OpenGL in the NVIDIA app</p>
            <p>see you later . ðŸ‘‹</p>
